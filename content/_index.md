# Welcome to Best Port To Play

## Introduction

The main idea of ​​this site is to collect information about the differences between different versions/ports of games and compare them. The initial idea is for each game to indicate on which platform the most complete version was released (with all the DLCs, with additional modes, etc.), the most stable version (Sonic' 06 on Xbox 360 works a little better than on PS3) and the most beautiful version. There can be more than one option in each category, as long as playing on multiple platforms is no different. In the "Most complete" category, there may not be a clear "winner" if multiple versions have exclusive features, then "none, closest: " is indicated, and their differences are listed in a comment.

## Contribution

It is impossible to collect information about all existing games alone, so if you know about a game that is not yet in the database, or have something to add to existing information, do not be too lazy to spend a couple of minutes and create a [PR on GitHub](https://github.com/NetLagina/best-port-to-play/). I appreciate your contribution to the history of the gaming industry :)
